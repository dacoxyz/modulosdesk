                    Modulos surface is comprised of Modules - surface tiles each capable of being connected to another one in any direction providing you with infinite possibilities. Since there are various models of modules with different functionalities available, you can create a surface that works the best for you, with functionalities spread out exactly how you like them.

                    And if you need to change your desk, you can simply rearrange or add new modules. No need to throw your old desk just because your needs have changed - with Modulos, your desk follows the change of your needs!

            <h1>Environmentally responsible by reducing waste</h1>

            <p>
                Currently there's a lot of material being just thrown away because the old desk got scratched in one place of the surface, it's leg broke, it's become too small or too big. The Modulos idea of owning a desk battles this wasteful practice. Why throw away good material and then cut down a bunch of trees for the new one, when you can replace only the part that you don't need or upgrade the whole thing?
